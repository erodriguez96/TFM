Database systems are becoming increasingly important in the world of computing, with the growth of web services and applications that are increasingly being implemented in each and every field of daily life, from major systems such as central government management of countries, to minor systems such as the simplest of applications.
In the event of finding a system of these characteristics compromised by some type of malfunction, corruption, or malware, in many cases it is of vital importance to discover the origin of the failure. In order to clarify the causes of a problem with this structure, forensic procedures are used on the systems. In the case of database systems, several processes are found, especially depending on the manufacturer of the system.
The objective of this project is to design, apply and evaluate a series of procedures for computer forensics on a free database system. The investigation is carried out with the intention of offering a catalogue of procedures that help the collection and analysis of forensic evidence generated by a database in a case as faithful to reality as possible within a laboratory environment.
